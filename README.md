# The-crane
The Crane is a project developed first during the Graphics course and then in the Virtual Reality course.
It is composed of a graphic engine built with OpenGL and a client that uses the engine to render and interact with a crane.

## Crane v1.0
The first version of The Crane is tagged with "vConsegna" and is built on OpenGL1.1.
It renders a crane and allows the users to interact with it using the keyboard.
It was developed by:
- Mattia Dell'Oca
- Luca Di Bello (https://github.com/lucadibello)
- Manuele Nolli (https://github.com/ManueleNolli)

## Crane v2.0
The second version of The Crane is tagged with "craneV2.0" and is built on OpenGL4.4.
It renders a crane in both stereoscopic and standard modes and allows the users to interact with it using either a hand-tracking device or the keyboard.
For stereoscopic rendering it uses SteamVR, and requires a LeapMotion (https://www.ultraleap.com/) for hand-tracking.
It was developed by:
